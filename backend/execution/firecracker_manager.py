# TO-DO please i think i might be over complicating this welp

# Import subprocess / firecracker sdk / OS libraries

# Function: execute_function_in_firecracker(code: str, language: str, timeout: int)
# - Prepare firecracker microvm image 
# - Inject user code into VM
# - Start microvm execution
# - Capture output / error
# - Measure execution time
# - Clean up VM
# - Return output, execution_time, status(success/failure), error_log (if any)
