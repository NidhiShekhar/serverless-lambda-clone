# Import Prometheus libraries (Counter, Histogram)

# Define Counter metric for:
# - Total API requests
# - Total function execution requests
# - Total failed executions

# Define Histogram metric for:
# - Function execution time (seconds)

# In each API route:
# - Increment relevant counters
# - Observe execution time in histograms

# Optional:
# Add custom labels like:
# - function_name
# - execution_status (success/failure)
